# image-preview-download
Prototype for selecting, previewing and downloading images back out of the browser.

This project is a prototype application for selecting image files, using the image data as a DataURI in CSS and applying it to different HTML Elements.

Additionally, this project shows how to:

-- Write a CSS File into a Zip File.
-- Write the image data back out of the browser into a Zip file using JSZip

It was a fun challenge and I'm sure there could be improvements, use at your own risk since it could really use some unit testing.
